# Balanced Binary Search Tree in Ruby

This is a simple implementation of a **Balanced Binary Search Tree** (BST) in Ruby. The tree maintains balance automatically to ensure operations such as insertion, deletion, and search run efficiently (in O(log n) time).

## Features

- Insert a value
- Delete a value
- Search for a value
- In-order traversal (sorted output)
- Maintains balance after insertions and deletions

## Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 2.5 or later)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the file to your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sadaaf/ruby-binary-tree
cd ruby-binary-tree
